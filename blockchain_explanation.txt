blockchain technology allows decentralized data storage without risk of manipulation.

transactions are conducted through "chains" of "blocks", and in order to manipulate a given transaction an attacker would need to control at least 50% of the blocks making up the transaction.

this is prevented by different mechanisms of limiting the amount of blocks a user can create, such as proof of work or the upcoming proof of stake.
